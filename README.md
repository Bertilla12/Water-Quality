# Water-Quality
* Water quality is a crucial aspect of environmental management, and it is essential to measure various physical, chemical, and biological parameters to monitor it 
  effectively.There are six parameters measured in this project.
* This dataset of 200 rows contains measurements of six critical water quality parameters widely used in water quality monitoring and analysis. The dataset 
  provides a representative snapshot of water quality and can be used for various research, education, and decision-making purposes.
## Description
* The six parameters measured in this project are:
* pH: pH measures the acidity or basicity of a liquid on a scale from 0 to 14. Values less than 7 indicate acidic conditions, values greater than 7 suggest primary 
  needs and a value of 7 indicates a neutral state.
* Dissolved Oxygen (DO): DO measures the amount of oxygen dissolved in water and is essential for aquatic life. High DO levels are crucial for the survival of fish 
  and other marine organisms.
* Temperature: Temperature affects various physical, chemical, and biological processes in water bodies. It is an essential factor that influences the rate of many 
  aquatic processes.
* Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD): BOD measures the amount of oxygen microorganisms require to decompose organic matter in water. High BOD levels can indicate that 
  the water is polluted with organic matter and may not be suitable for consumption or recreation.
* Total Suspended Solids (TSS): TSS measures the amount of solids suspended in water, including organic matter, sediment, and other pollutants. High TSS levels can 
  indicate poor water quality and affect aquatic life and other uses of water.
* Nitrate-Nitrogen (NO3-N): NO3-N measures the amount of nitrate in water. Nitrate is an essential nutrient for plant growth, but high nitrate levels in drinking 
  water can harm human health.
## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* intel log in is needed before initiating the program.
* Windows 11
### Installing
* The project data set in available in kaggle and the dataset can be downloaded from it. 
* Once if the installation is completed , we can rename and use it for the further purpose. 
### Executing program
* To run the program upload the data set in the jupyter workspace and start coding. 
* import pandas as pd
  It is used in python nomenclature for creating as alias. 
* import linear_model
  It is a class of the sklearn module if contain different functions for performing machine learning with linear models. 
* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  matplotlib. pyplot is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB.
* import plotly.express as px
  The plotly.express module (usually imported as px ) contains functions that can create entire figures at once, and is referred to as Plotly Express or PX. Plotly 
  Express is a built-in part of the plotly library, and is the recommended starting point for creating most common figures.
* import seaborn as sns
  The import seaborn portion of the code tells Python to bring the Seaborn library into your current environment. The as sns portion of the code then tells Python 
  to give Seaborn the alias of sns. This allows you to use Seaborn functions by simply typing sns. function_name rather than seaborn. function_name.
* import statsmodels.api as sma
  statsmodels API are the models that are called by using Application Programming Interface also called as APIs.
## conclusion
* We can see errors frequently while coding , in that case do fix that error by browsing either in google or chat gpt . 
* Undergo many researches and apply one among the best code to fix the error
